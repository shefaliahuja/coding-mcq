An algorithm performs (logN)1/2 find operations, N insert operations, (logN)1/2 delete operations, and (logN)1/2 decrease-key operations on a set of data items with keys drawn from a linearly ordered set. For a delete operation, a pointer is provided to the record that must be deleted. For the decrease-key operation, a pointer is provided to the record that has its key decreased. Which one of the following data structures is the most suited for the algorithm to use, if the goal is to achieve the best total asymptotic complexity considering all the operations?
Unsorted array
Min-heap
Sorted array
Sorted doubly linked list
Array    GATE-CS-2015 (Set 1)
